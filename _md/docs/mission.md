## Mission

Our mission is to create an open social platform that's native to the Web. We want our applications to be hackable and our social networks to be designed by users.

The principles behind our mission are:

|Principle|Why|
|-|-|
|Simple|The protocol should be easy to understand and implement.|
|Free (as in Freedom)|Users should retain ownership of their networks.|
|Interoperable|Users should be able to introduce their own schemas.|
|Files-oriented|Data should be easy to examine and understand.|
|Decentralized|Users should never be tied to a service.|
|Local-first|Applications should be able to run without an internet connection.|
|Private|Users should control where their information goes.|
